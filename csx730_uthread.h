/**
 * @file
 * A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be 
 * managed independently by a scheduler. A <b>user-mode thread</b>, sometimes referred to
 * as a <i>fiber</i>, is one that is scheduled in user mode instead of kernel mode. In user mode,
 * only a single thread can execute at a time. After some time, the current thread that
 * is executing will be temporarily interrupted by some signal, the disposition of which
 * should trigger a context switch to another thread without requiring either thread's 
 * cooperation. The basic idea is that these context switches should occur so quickly that
 * all threads appear to execute concurrently. Special care should be taken to block 
 * signals during a context switch. 
 *
 * <p>
 * Each thread gets its own stack that is separate from the stack of the calling process
 * but somewhere within the process's virtual memory space. While this new stack space
 * can be allocated using @c malloc(3), use of @c mmap(2) is recommended as it guarantees
 * the memory will be allocated at a nearby page boundary. You should 
 * <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/294001/">actively avoid</a> use of the @c MAP_GROWSDOWN
 * flag when using @c mmap(2) for a stack. Instead simply treat the returned pointer to 
 * the mapped area as the end of the stack, then add the stack size to compute the 
 * initial stack pointer value.
 *
 * <p>
 * The @c _CS670_SOURCE feature test macro defines additional functions for user-mode threads.
